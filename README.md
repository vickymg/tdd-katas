TDD Katas
---------

A repo to practice code katas in Ruby - TDD style.

* Roman Numerals - to convert arabic numbers to equivalent roman numerals
* Numerals to Arabic - the reverse of the above!
* String Calculator - to return the sum of numbers passed in as strings
* FizzBuzz JS - the fizzbuzz exercise in JavaScript
* Odds & Evens - returns 'odd' or 'even' for numbers 1 to 100, except for primes, for which it returns the number itself
